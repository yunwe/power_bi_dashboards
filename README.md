# Saw Yu Nwe | Data Analyst

## 👋 About Me
I am a Software Engineer with 7 years of experience in Game Development, currently pivoting into Data Analytics and Data Science. 
My background in game programming has given me a deep appreciation for complex systems, real-time logic, and user behavior—which I now apply to uncovering actionable insights through data.

After a 3-year career break to focus on my family, I have returned to the tech landscape with a sharpened focus on **Product Analytics**. 
I am passionate about how data-driven decisions can optimize product performance and improve user experiences. 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
